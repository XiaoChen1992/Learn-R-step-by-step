# Control flow Part 2

Last time, we were starting to talk about control flow and we introduced the `for` loop. Today we will discuss while loop. Basically, for loop and while loop are the same thing. You could use a `while` loop to rewrite a `for` loop. The difference between `for` loop and `while` loop is that in some case `for` loop is more readable, and in the rest cases while loop is better. It is depends on you to choose which loop you want to use.

Before we begin with `while` loop, we need to understand the basic logical operations. Next, we will use them often

R provides three logical operators.

* AND operator`&`

* OR operator `|` ( **This is not I !!!**)
* NOT operator !

We will use examples to explain each of theme.

**AND &**:

```R
# and operation
> T & T
[1] TRUE
> F & F
[1] FALSE
> T & F
[1] FALSE
# you cannot use and instead of &
# R will return you error
> T and T
Error: unexpected symbol in "T and"
> T AND T
Error: unexpected symbol in "T AND"
```

As you can see,  R only return TRUE when both sides are TRUE. We do not only use TRUE and FALSE to compare but also we could examine some operations.

```R
> (1 < 2) & (5 > 4)
[1] TRUE
> (1 < 2) & (length("Hello") > 4)
[1] FALSE
```

**OR |**:

```R
> T | T
[1] TRUE
> F | F
[1] FALSE
> T | F
[1] TRUE
> (1 < 2) | (length("Hello") > 4)
[1] TRUE
```

For or operation, R will only return FALSE when both sides are FALSE. 

**NOT !**:

```R
> !T
[1] FALSE
> !F
[1] TRUE
> x <- 4
> !(x > 5)
[1] TRUE
# combine ! and = is != which means not equal
> x != 5
[1] TRUE
```

So far,  we know how to use logical operators. For `&` and `|`, we could use them to compare vectors.

```R
# R will compare each pair of two sides
# I recommend you compare them on parper by yourself
> ((-2:2) >= 0) & ((-2:2) <= 0)
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
> ((-2:2) >= 0) | ((-2:2) <= 0)
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

Sometimes, we just want compare the first pair of two vectors. We use `&&` and `||` to do this.

```R
# R only compare the first pair
> ((-2:2) >= 0) && ((-2:2) <= 0)
[1] FALSE
> ((-2:2) >= 0) || ((-2:2) <= 0)
[1] TRUE
```

OK, we are done with logical operation. Let's continue on while loop.
